name: agent-loop
description: Run a delegated agent-loop role orchestration when the user explicitly invokes $agent-loop.
# OpenCode also discovers ~/.agents/skills, lists this skill to the model, and
# the model auto-invokes it for an /agent-loop request. Hide it from OpenCode's
# model list so the installed OpenCode plugin command owns /agent-loop and
# supplies the session id.

Read `{{AGENT_LOOP_INSTRUCTIONS}}` and follow it for this request. The file is a
core that is expected to fit in one read, but when a read is capped, read
again with an offset until the end of the file. It names reference files to
read when their conditions hold. Run every
`agent-loop` command in the instructions as `__AGENT_LOOP_CLI__` instead, so the
run does not depend on the `agent-loop` command resolving on PATH.
